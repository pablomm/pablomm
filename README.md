### Hi there 👋

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile!

I am passionate about technology, but especially Artificial Intelligence for Computer Vision and Neuroscience. Lately, I used to spend my time here working on experiments for image and audio generation, exploring their applications to Neuroscience 🧠🚀

Here you'll find old university stuff and some hobby projects 🫶
